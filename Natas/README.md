# Natas - Web Security Challenges 🌐🔐
Natas is a series of web security challenges designed to teach the basics of server-side web security. Each level of Natas consists of its own website located at `http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org`, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login required. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g., `natas0` for level 0) and its password.

## Objective 🎯
The objective of each level is to obtain the password for the next level and progress further. Each level has access to the password of the next level, and your task is to find a way to obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are stored in the directory `/etc/natas_webpass/`. For example, the password for `natas5` is stored in the file `/etc/natas_webpass/natas5` and is only readable by `natas4` and `natas5`.

## Getting Started 🚀
Start with the first level:
- **Username:** natas0
- **Password:** natas0
- **URL:** [http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org](http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org)

## Instructions 🕹️
1. Access the provided URL for each level.
2. Use the provided username and password to log in.
3. Explore the website and find vulnerabilities to obtain the password for the next level.
4. Continue the process until you complete all levels.

Have fun learning and happy hacking! 🌐🔐

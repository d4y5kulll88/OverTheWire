# Welcome to Krypton!
This game is intended to provide hands-on experience with cryptography and cryptanalysis. The levels progress from classic ciphers to modern ones, gradually increasing in difficulty.

Although there are excellent public tools, like Cryptool, available for simple analysis, we strongly encourage you to try solving these challenges without them initially. We will introduce them in later exercises.

**Please try these levels without Cryptool first.**

## Level 1

The first level is easy. The password for level 2 is in the file 'krypton2'. It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13. The ciphertext is in a non-standard format. When using alpha characters for ciphertext, it is normal to group the letters into 5-letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns.

This file has kept the plaintext word boundaries and carried them to the ciphertext.

Enjoy!

# OverTheWire Bandit Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bandit wargame, an engaging challenge designed for absolute beginners. This game aims to teach fundamental skills essential for playing other wargames.

## Getting Started

### Level Structure

The game is organized into levels, starting from Level 0. Your goal is to "beat" or "finish" each level, which unlocks information on how to proceed to the next one. The website's pages for each level contain instructions on transitioning from the previous level. You can find links to all levels in the sidemenu on the left.

## Note for VM Users

If you are using a virtual machine (VM) and face issues connecting to overthewire.org via SSH with a "broken pipe error" when the network adapter is set to NAT mode, add the setting `IPQoS throughput` to `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, consider changing the adapter to Bridged mode.
